# Volume-Renderer

This project was created as a Final project for the class "CIS 410, Scientific Visualization".

The purpose of the project is to read a 3D data set, and sample locations along rays cast from the camera through the "pixels" on the screen. In doing this, and after applying a transfer function to the samples, the entire dataset is viewable in one image.
